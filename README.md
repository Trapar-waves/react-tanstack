> A React-based project leveraging TanStack's tools for state management, routing, and asynchronous data handling.

## ✨ Features

* **Modern UI Framework:** Built using React (v19.x) for a component-driven interface.
* **Efficient State Management:** Likely utilizes [@tanstack/react-query](https://tanstack.com/query) for server state management, including caching, background updates, and data fetching.
* **Client-Side Navigation:** Implements client-side routing via [@tanstack/react-router](https://tanstack.com/router), offering seamless SPA navigation.
* **Utility-First Styling:** Employs [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for flexible, utility-first styling with minimal configuration.
* **Type Safety:** Leverages TypeScript to improve code quality and reduce runtime errors in both React components and application logic.
* **Fast Development Workflow:** Utilizes [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) for optimized builds and quick development server starts.
* **Developer Tools Integration:** Includes [@tanstack/react-query-devtools](https://tanstack.com/query/devtools) and [@tanstack/react-router-devtools](https://tanstack.com/router/devtools) for debugging state and routing issues during development.
* **Focus on Code Quality:** Configures ESLint with plugins like [@tanstack/eslint-plugin-query](https://tanstack.com/query/eslint) and [@tanstack/eslint-plugin-router](https://tanstack.com/router/eslint) to enforce best practices for query and router usage.
